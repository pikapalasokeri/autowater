AB Electronics C Libraries
=====

C Libraries and demo code to work with Raspberry Pi expansion boards from http://www.abelectronics.co.uk

To download to your Raspberry Pi type in terminal: 

```
git clone https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_C_Libraries.git
```

###ADCDAC Pi
This library reads ADC inputs and writes to DAC outputs on the [ADCDAC Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/39/ADC-DAC-Pi-Raspberry-Pi-ADC-and-DAC-expansion-board "ADCDAC Pi").

###ADC Differential Pi
This library reads input values from the [ADC Differential Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/65/ADC-Differential-Pi-Raspberry-Pi-Analogue-to-Digital-converter "ADC Differential Pi") and [Delta Sigma Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/14/Delta-Sigma-Pi "Delta Sigma Pi").

###ADC Pi
This library reads input values from the [ADC Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/17/ADC-Pi-V2---Raspberry-Pi-Analogue-to-Digital-converter "ADC Pi") and [ADC Pi Plus ](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/56/ADC-Pi-Plus---Raspberry-Pi-Analogue-to-Digital-converter "ADC Pi Plus").


###IO Pi
This library reads and writes to the [IO Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/18/IO-Pi "IO Pi") and [IO Pi Plus](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/54/IO-Pi-Plus "IO Pi Plus").

###Servo Pi
This library controls the pwm outputs on the [Servo PWM Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/44/Servo-PWM-Pi "Servo PWM Pi") and [Servo PWM Pi Zero](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/72/Servo-PWM-Pi-Zero "Servo PWM Pi Zero")

We will be adding further C demos in the future for our boards.
